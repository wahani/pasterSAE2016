- You can use predefined generators, e.g. for spatially correlated variates, or include univariate random number generators from `R`.
- `sim_gen` defines the position in the chain. `gen_generic` controls the generation process and accepts any random number generator. Also we defined shortcuts like `sim_gen_generic` to be less verbose.
- In the following you see a definition for drawing numbers from a linear mixed model. The response is constructed with an R expression and set by `sim_resp_eq`.

```{r}
setup <- sim_base() %>% # default with 100 areas (domains) and 100 units each
  sim_gen(gen_generic(rnorm, sd = 4, name = "x")) %>% 
  sim_gen(gen_generic(rnorm, sd = 4, name = "e")) %>%
  sim_gen_generic(rnorm, sd = 2, groupVars = "idD", name = "v") %>%
  sim_resp_eq(y = 100 + 2 * x + v + e)
setup
```
