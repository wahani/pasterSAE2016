```{r eval=FALSE}
setup1 <- setup %>% sim_sample(sample_number(5))
setup2 <- setup %>% sim_sample(sample_fraction(0.05))
```

- `setup1` and `setup2` only differ in the specific way samples are drawn. 
- `sim_sample` inserts the sampling function at the appropriate position in the process.
- For every step in the process tools are named using the corresponding prefix, e.g. `gen_generic` for \textit{data generation} or `sample_fraction` for \textit{drawing samples}.
